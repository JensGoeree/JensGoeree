### Brief introduction.

My name is Jens Goeree and i am a third year BSc archaeology student! I hold a degree in ecology & wildlife studies and i am more than interested in the symbiotic relationship between these fields! Besides my study, i work as a GIS technician for a company within the cultural heritage/archaeological sector.

Some of my interests within (digital) archaeology are: object based image analysis (obia), predictive modeling, agent based modeling, (uav) photogrammetry and landscape archaeology.

Within the field of ecology my interests are: Rewilding projects across Europe, paleoecology and ecotourism.
